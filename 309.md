# ‚úèÔ∏è MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification

This project demonstrates **handwritten digit classification** using the MNIST dataset and **Logistic Regression**. The model predicts digits (0-9) from grayscale images of handwritten numbers.

---

## üîπ Objective

Classify handwritten digits from the **MNIST dataset** using Logistic Regression and evaluate model performance. Additionally, visualize some predictions to inspect model accuracy.

---

## üîπ Features

- Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset from OpenML  
- Normalize pixel values for faster training  
- Train a **Logistic Regression** model for multi-class classification  
- Evaluate performance using:
  - Accuracy score  
  - Classification report (precision, recall, f1-score)  
- Visualize example predictions  
- Save trained model for future use  

---

## üîπ Workflow

1. Load the MNIST dataset using `fetch_openml`  
2. Normalize the image pixel values to range [0, 1]  
3. Split dataset into training and testing sets  
4. Train **Logistic Regression** model with multinomial classification  
5. Make predictions on the test set  
6. Evaluate model accuracy and print classification metrics  
7. Visualize a few example predictions with their true and predicted labels  
8. Save the trained model using `joblib` for reuse  

---

## üîπ Visualizations

- Display 10 example images from the test set with **true vs predicted labels**  
- Helps to inspect the model‚Äôs performance qualitatively
