# üí≥ Fraud Detection using Logistic Regression and SMOTE

This project demonstrates **fraud detection** using a synthetic dataset of normal and fraudulent transactions. The project explores handling **imbalanced datasets** using SMOTE and evaluates models using classification metrics and visualizations.

---

## üîπ Objective

Predict whether a transaction is fraudulent based on features like:  
- Transaction **amount**  
- Transaction **time**  
- **Distance from home**  

The project compares the performance of a **standard Logistic Regression model** versus a **model trained on a balanced dataset using SMOTE**.

## üîπ Features

- **Synthetic dataset generation** for normal and fraudulent transactions  
- **Data preprocessing:** scaling features using StandardScaler  
- **Model training:** Logistic Regression  
- **Handling imbalanced classes:** SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)  
- **Model evaluation:** classification report, confusion matrix  
- **Feature importance analysis:** visualizing the impact of each feature

## üîπ Workflow

1. Generate synthetic fraud dataset with normal and fraudulent transactions  
2. Split dataset into training and testing sets  
3. Scale features using StandardScaler  
4. Train Logistic Regression model **without handling imbalance**  
5. Apply SMOTE to balance the training dataset  
6. Train Logistic Regression model on the **balanced dataset**  
7. Evaluate both models using:
   - Classification report (precision, recall, f1-score)  
   - Confusion matrix visualization  
8. Analyze feature importance to identify key factors in fraud detection

## üîπ Visualizations

- **Confusion Matrix:** Compare predicted vs actual labels for both models  
- **Feature Importance:** Bar plot showing the influence of each feature in fraud detection
